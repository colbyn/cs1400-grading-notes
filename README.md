Running into some common problems with students, so I’m documenting such things here for the purpose of reducing redundancy. 

# Overview

I’m trying to avoid sharing direct links to files, since if the file path changes it’ll break any preexisting links to such files (on the master branch). So instead, just use the following [Important Files Section](##Important-Files) as a lookup table.

## Important Files

| File Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `worksheets/pseudocode-format.md` | misc notes/documentation about the **pseudocode format** |
