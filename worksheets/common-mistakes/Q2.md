# Common Problems

## No table

This isn't proper formatting of the data (i.e. should be a table). The data should be displayed in two tables documenting your program inputs and outputs respectively. If you are having trouble with creating tables using the wysiwyg from canvas, you may reach out to the instructor or myself.

## Everything seems to be just one table

This is good! But it's hard to distinguish the two tables, in the future, please add a newline between the first and second table.

# Missing table header

This is good, but you are missing the "table header" which labels to the given columns.
