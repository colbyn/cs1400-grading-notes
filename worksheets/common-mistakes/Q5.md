## Too vague

### Reply 1:

Please be more specific, this doesn't need to be actual code (nor does it need to be perfect), but something akin to three real word assertions (preferably formatted as a list of three entries).

### Reply 2:

Please be a bit more specific. E.g. how would you test for [...]? Likewise, the program accepts multiple inputs, so therefore when you say [...], also mention the input source(s) associated with the given constraint. 


## Format

This is good (but preferably formatted as a list of three entries).
