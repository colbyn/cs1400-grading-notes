# Common Problems

## Too vague

### Reply 1:

Please be more specific, this doesn't need to be actual code (nor does it need to be perfect), but something akin to three real word assertions (preferably formatted as a list of three entries).

### Reply 2:

Please be a bit more specific. E.g. how would you test for [...]? Likewise, the program accepts multiple inputs, so therefore when you say [...], also mention the input source(s) associated with the given constraint. 


## Format

This is good (but preferably formatted as a list of three entries).


# Example

1. Entering [...] and [...] for [...] results in [...] printed to the console and the termination of the program with a non-zero exit code.
2. Entering [...] for [...] and [...] for [...] results in [...] [...]
3. The program should output a non-empty file named [...]
