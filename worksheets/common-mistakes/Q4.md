# Common Problems

## Incorrect Formatting

For the worksheet assignments, the expected pseudocode format should be something akin to an ordered list, analogous to the sequential order in which your actual code will be executed at runtime. E.g.
1. Do X.
2. Do Y.
3. Do Z. 
â€¦
If you have further questions, you can contact me or the instructor for further clarification.

Also, if it helps, I've jotted down some misc notes about the expected expected pseudocode format on this GitHub repo: https://github.com/colbyn/cs1400-grading-notes/blob/master/worksheets/pseudocode-format.md

Hope this helps! ðŸ™‚
