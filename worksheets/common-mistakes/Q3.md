# Common Problems

## Too technical

Good job! Although the scope of your answer includes low-level implementation specific details that you wouldn't ordinarily include in a high-level outline of a project. As the description said: "I'm not giving exact steps, just a basic elevator pitch". So therefore, this should really be part of your pseudocode outline.

For instance, checking for a value error should be implicit when asked to parse numerical values from a given string. This isn‚Äôt something you would typically need to convey in a ‚Äúbasic elevator pitch‚Äù, because it‚Äôs just obvious implementation specific details. As mentioned, checking for e.g. a value error should really be part of your pseudocode outline. 

I.e. imagine you are some software architect, and not "in the trenches" so to speak. 

PS: this is good work, and the problem is trivial, so therefore you should try resubmitting this for a better grade.  üôÇ
