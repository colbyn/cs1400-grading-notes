# Pseudocode Format

For the worksheet assignments, the expected pseudocode format should be something akin to an ordered list, analogous to the sequential order in which your actual code will be executed at runtime. 

E.g.
```
1. Do X.
2. Do Y.
3. Do Z. 
… 
```


**Remember, don’t use sentences, mathematical formulas, or python code.**
Don’t simply use newlines to denote individual instructions, use an ordered list (which may be nested if appropriate). 

## Example

Here is an example for a simple script that prompts the user for some inputs, computes a summary value, and prints out the results.

### Good

1. Get the number of [...] from user
1. Get the number of [...] from user
2. Convert [...] to ints
3. Check for [...]
4. Check for [...]
5. Compute [...] for each [...]
6. Compute [...] for [...]
7. Compute [...] from [...]
8. Compute [...] from remaining [...]
9. Print out [...] following the formatting specifications



The above is just an example, especially the given format. For instance, instead of this format:
> Get the number of [...] from user

Can could have written:
> Prompt the user for the number of [...]


### Bad

<div style="border: 1px solid #262626">
<p>Get the number of [...] from user</p><br/>
<p>Get the number of [...] from user</p><br/>
<p>Convert [...] to ints</p><br/>
<p>Check for [...]</p><br/>
<p>Check for [...]</p><br/>
<p>Compute [...] for each [...]</p><br/>
<p>Compute [...] for [...]</p><br/>
<p>Compute [...] from [...]</p><br/>
<p>Compute [...] from remaining [...]</p><br/>
<p>Print out [...] following the formatting specifications</p>
</div>

Regarding the above, don’t simply use newlines to denote individual instructions, use an ordered list (which may be nested if appropriate).
